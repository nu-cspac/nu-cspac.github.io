# Northwestern University Computer Science PhD Advisory Council

## Check out our [new wiki](https://github.com/nu-cspac/nu-cspac-wiki/wiki)! This is for everyone to use to share information about the CS department: 

## The Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (CSPAC) has a two-fold mission:
We seek to foster a community among Computer Science PhD students (CSPhDs), 
defined as all PhD students at Northwestern University who take one of the 
Computer Science qualifying exams outlined in the Graduate Student Manual 
in order to advance to candidacy in their degree. To this end, we:
* Provide funding for groups, activities, and events organized by CSPhDs
* Organize division-wide activities
* Serve as liaisons between CSPhDs, the department administrators, and faculty as needed

We seek to give a voice to CSPhDs in department decisions that directly impact student life. These include, but are not limited to:
* CSPhD student admissions
* Faculty hiring
* CSPhD student office spaces and locations
* Changes to CSPhD student graduation requirements
* Advocacy for diversity of background and viewpoint at all levels

The mission of the Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (CSPAC) is to foster a community within the student body of Computer Science 
PhD students at Northwestern University, and to give this community a voice within the Computer Science Division.
