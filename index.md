## Our Mission
The mission of the Computer Science PhD Advisory Council is to promote the well-being of CSPhDs through advocacy and information-sharing. We seek to create and curate an accessible informational repository to connect CSPhDs with the resources they need for a healthy and productive graduate experience. We strive to elevate the voice and power of CSPhD students to address concerns that directly impact student life, including departmental policies and decisions.

## Specific Ways That We Help

- We provide information about starting student groups
- We host advocacy events to inform and further the interests of CSPhDs
